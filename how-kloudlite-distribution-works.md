# How Kloudlite Distribution works ?

Distribution works by managing the flow of software artifacts from their source to end-users or target environments. It involves generating artifacts through build processes, storing them in repositories, controlling access through authentication mechanisms, and delivering them via distribution channels such as direct downloads or automated deployments. Throughout this process, versioning, dependency management, and monitoring ensure reliability, security, and efficiency, facilitating the deployment and operation of software applications across diverse computing environments.
